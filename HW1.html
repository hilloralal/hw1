            <h2> About Avocado</h2>
            <p> avocado, (Persea americana), tree of the family Lauraceae and its edible fruit. Avocados are native to the Western Hemisphere from Mexico south to the Andean regions and are widely grown in warm climates. Avocado fruits have greenish or yellowish flesh with a buttery consistency and a rich nutty flavour. They are often eaten in salads, and in many parts of the world they are eaten as a dessert. Mashed avocado is the principal ingredient of guacamole, a characteristic saucelike condiment in Mexican cuisine. Avocados provide thiamin, riboflavin, and vitamin A, and in some varieties the flesh contains as much as 25 percent unsaturated oil. </p>

            <h2> Physical description </h2>
            <p> Avocado trees can be tall or spreading, and they have elliptic to egg-shaped leaves that are 10–30 cm (4–12 inches) in length. The small greenish flowers are borne in dense inflorescences and lack true petals. The flowers have nine stamens, arranged in three series, and a one-celled ovary. Interestingly, there are two types of avocado flowers, A and B, depending on the cultivar. These flowers are dichogamous (male and female parts mature separately), and each flower opens only twice. Type A flowers are functionally female in the morning, close at midday, and then reopen as functionally male in the afternoon of the following day. Type B flowers are functionally female in the afternoon, close in the evening, and then reopen the following morning as functionally male. When the two flower types are grown together, this temporal overlap of mature male and female parts encourages cross-pollination and, thus, greater fruit production. TThe fruit is exceedingly variable in size, no larger than a hen’s egg in certain Mexican races and sometimes weighing 1–2 kg (2–4 pounds) in other races. The form varies from round to pear-shaped with a long slender neck, and the colour ranges from green to dark purple. Botanically, the fruit is a berry and features a single large round seed with two cotyledons. The fruit’s outer skin is sometimes no thicker than that of an apple and sometimes is coarse and woody in texture.</p>

            <h2> History and production</h2>
            <p> Avocados were first domesticated in tropical America, where they were cultivated as individual seedling trees before the Spanish conquest. The plants did not receive serious horticultural attention until about 1900, when horticulturists found that production of grafted trees was simple and allowed perpetuation of superior seedlings and the establishment of orchards. Flourishing avocado industries have since developed around the world in suitable climates. Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Indonesia, and Colombia were the top producers worldwide in 2020. The fruits are also grown commercially in Florida, California, Hawaii, Kenya, Haiti, Chile, South Africa, Brazil, and Australia, as well as on some Pacific islands and in several Mediterranean countries, including Israel. </p>
